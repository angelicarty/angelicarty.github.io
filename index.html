		<p>A picture taking exploration game.</p>
		<p>As the sole programmer, with Design and Arts by RuoXuan, Emma, and Flora from 
		RMIT GDS6 class.<br />
		-Heavy UI work, real time targetting system and hints<br />
		<br />
		I was incharge of implementing ideas from the designers into the game itself. The game is about 
		taking pictures from certain position and angle of a monument. Upon taking the respective pictures, information about the monument will be shown to the player in the player's album. 
		Players can not only gain information bout the place through the album, players can also learn information of certain items when viewed through the camera. <br />
		<br />
		This project highlighted the importance of communication and time management while working in a team, as a person's work not only impact another's but also could either help or hinder their progress. 
		Communication was key was my work revolved around implementing someone else's idea. This required me to make sure that I have a full understanding of a person's idea before jumping into it.

		<p>A turn based 2D RPG with childhood fantasy being the main theme.</p>
		<p>As the lead designer and programmer, as part of my final year project.<br />
		With basic rpg elements such as quests, shops, and traumatised npcs.<br />
		<br />
		As the sole designer and person in charge of the project, I had to make sure the project could be completed up to a certain standard within the time frame regardless of the situations that occurs as it goes on.
		This was especially hard as the projects begins during the time of which the covid situation was spreading rapidly. I had artists who had to leave the project due to this issue, alongside artists who's 
		work was hindered. This has caused me to rescope and replan, removing and changing features to fit what was realistic for both the artist and me. <br />
		While I understand that it was on my own doing that I should choose not to use ready-made assets, I made the decision before the situation got out of hand and wanted to fit a certain aesthetic and into the theme 
		of the project.
