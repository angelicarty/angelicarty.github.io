		<h6>Trailer made by RuoXuan</h6>
		
		<p>A picture taking exploration game.</p>
		<p>As the sole programmer, with Design and Arts by RuoXuan, Emma, and Flora from 
		RMIT GDS6 class.<br />
		-Heavy UI work, real time targetting system and hints<br />
		<br />
		I was in charge of implementing ideas from the designers into the game itself. The game is about 
		taking pictures from certain position and angle of a monument. Upon taking the respective pictures, information about the monument will be shown to the player in the player's album. 
		Players can not only gain information bout the place through the album, players can also learn information of certain items when viewed through the camera. <br />
		<br />
		This project highlighted the importance of communication and time management while working in a team, as a person's work not only impact another's but also could either help or hinder their progress. 
		Communication was key as my work revolved around implementing someone else's idea. This required me to make sure that I have a full understanding of a person's idea before jumping into it. <br />
		<br />
		While I have learnt a lot from this, given the opportunity to do it again, I would have done many of the things differently, in cases where optimization could be done or simply improving the quality of production.
		
		<!--
		My assigned role placed me in charge of implementing ideas from the designers into a photo capturing game where the specific position and angle of the lens play a key part in receiving clues and tips about a monument.
        The learned information is then stored in the player’s album where it can be viewed for convenience. While information about the monument’s location is crucial, the player can also gain knowledge and insight 
		about certain items when they are viewed through the camera. If the player is struck,there is a hint system which will assist them with the camera’s position and angle.<br />
        <br />
        This project highlights the importance of communication, time management as well as teamwork as the progress of each player impacts their teammate’s, either helping the group reach their goal 
		or hindering each other’s hard work.
		Through the game’s process, my peers/group and I carried out tasks where we discussed ideas and aspects suggested by one another. It was important for me to articulate the vision we had in mind and I believe I managed
		to articulate the instructions given to me by receiving guidance and a full understanding of the project’s goal. Apart from that, I also bettered my coding, comradeship and interpersonal skills.

		<h3 style=""><a href="IDMPA">The Tale of Bear<sup style="vertical-align: super;  font-size: smaller;">2</sup></a></h3>
		<p>A turn based 2D RPG with childhood fantasy being the main theme.</p>
		<p>As the lead designer and programmer, as part of my final year project.<br />
		With basic rpg elements such as quests, shops, and traumatised npcs.<br />
		<br />
		As the sole designer and person in charge of the project, I had to make sure the project could be completed up to a certain standard within the time frame regardless of the situations that occurs as it goes on.
		This was especially hard as the projects begins during the time of which the covid situation was spreading rapidly. I had artists who had to leave the project due to this issue, alongside artists who's 
		work was hindered. This has caused me to rescope and replan, removing and changing features to fit what was realistic for both the artist and me. <br />
		Despite being short-staff and limited, knowing that using ready made-assets would take a lot of time on my end of finding a new artist, I decided not to do so as I wanted to keep the original vision, themes and mechanics I had in mind.

		As the sole designer and person in charge of the project, my responsibility was to manage and resolve any setbacks or issues that would push back deadlines or hinder the project’s completion.
        This was especially hard as the project began during the peak of covid when the virus was spreading rapidly. I had artists either leaving or delaying the submission of their art for the project. This caused me to rescope and replan, removing and changing features to fit what was realistic for both the artist and me. <br />
